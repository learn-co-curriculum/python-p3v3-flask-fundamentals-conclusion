# Conclusion to Flask Fundamentals

## Learning Goals

- Describe the components of a web application framework.
- Build and run a Flask application on your computer.
- Manipulate and test the structure of a request object.
- Extend a Flask application to meet the unique requirements of different
  projects.

## Key Vocab

- **Web Framework**: software that is designed to support the development of web
  applications. Web frameworks provide built-in tools for generating web
  servers, turning Python objects into HTML, and more.
- **Extension**: a package or module that adds functionality to a Flask
  application that it does not have by default.
- **Request**: an attempt by one machine to contact another over the internet.
- **Client**: an application or machine that accesses services being provided by
  a server through the internet.
- **Web Server**: a combination of software and hardware that uses Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols to respond to requests made over
  the internet.
- **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)**: an interface between web servers and
  applications.
- **Template Engine**: software that takes in strings with tokenized values,
  replacing the tokens with their values as output in a web browser.

## Conclusion

Flask gives us the ability to write Python code that generates content and serve
it to users on the internet. In this module, we learned a number of skills that
will help us make flexible and powerful websites later on:

- Configuring WSGIs and web servers.
- Routing to views at fixed and parameterized URLs.
- Using application and request context to deliver information from the internet
  to our views.
